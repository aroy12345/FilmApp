Developed a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in OCaml that enables users to perform ”paint” board functionalities, such as drawing geometric images, shapes, lines, and shapes with varying colors, texture, sizes, and line styles. Additionally, implemented a two-player Snakes and Ladders game with a GUI using Java Swing.
